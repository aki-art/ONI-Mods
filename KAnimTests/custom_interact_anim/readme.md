To get a starter SCML file, convert: body_comp_default_0.png + body_comp_default_build.bytes + <any duplicant animation>_anim.bytes

when converting back, it is only the _anim files you will need. the build file and png should be either empty, or used for extra props, do not leave in any references to default duplicant body parts in the build file, unless you want to override something.
